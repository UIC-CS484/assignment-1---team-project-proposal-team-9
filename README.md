# Assignment 1

Team 9:
Hector Cedeno-Indriago, Jonathan Chen, Bryan Emer

Team 9 decided on a branching strategy to manage the project. For this particular assignment though, we mostly worked on the main branch, pulling and resolving conflicts when necessary.

As we progress on the project, task will be shared according to who is best fit for the task and the amount of workload each team-member has. This means that all three team-members can work on Front-End, Back-End, and Security Implementation.

To build the project, we will be using a relational database such as SQLite, passport.js, a responsive design framework such as Bootstrap or Foundation, React, our preferred IDEs, RESTFul APIs, a data visualization framework, a unit test framework, and GitHub.
