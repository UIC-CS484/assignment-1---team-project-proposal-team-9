# Team 9's Project Proposal

## Workflow Strategy
We decided on a branching strategy to manage the project. For this particular assignment though, we mostly worked on the main branch, pulling and resolving conflicts when necessary.

## Team Members and Responsibilities
As we progress on the project, task will be shared according to who is best fit for the task and the amount of workload each team-member has. However, generally speaking, each member will be responsible for one major area, as follows:
* Hector Cedeno-Indriago - Front-End Features
* Jonathan Chen - Security Implementation
* Bryan Emer - Back-End Features

## Development Tools
To build the project, we will be using a relational database such as SQLite, passport.js, a responsive design framework such as Bootstrap or Foundation, React, our preferred IDEs, RESTFul APIs, a data visualization framework, a unit test framework, and GitHub.
